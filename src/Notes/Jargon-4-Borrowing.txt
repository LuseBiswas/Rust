**Borrowing**
 
So there will be 3 cases of Owenership and Borrowers

1.) Rihana will only have 1 Owner

2.) Rihana will have 1 Owner and Multiple Borrowers (but no Hanky Panky)

3.)Rihana will have 1 Owner and 1 Borrower(With Hanky Panky) but after that not other Borrower can be there even with No Hanky Panky
 
**Refrences**

Refrences mean giving the address of a string rather than the ownership of the string over to a funtion

Example:

fn main(){

    let s1: String::from("Hello");

    lest s2 = &s1;
 
    println!("{}",s2);

    println!("{}",s1);

}
 
Borrowing

You can transferring ownership of variable to functions. By passing a refrence to the string to the funtion take_ownership, 

the ownership of the string remains with the oriignal varaible, in the main funtion. This allows you to use my_string again after the funtion call.

Example:

fn main(){

    let my_string = String::from("Hello, Rust");

    take_owernship(&my_string);

    println!("{}", my_string);

}

fn take_owernship(some_string: &String){

}

 ----------------------------------------------------

Example of hanky Panke
fn main(){
let s1 = String::from("Hello");
update_str(&mut s1)
println!("{}",s1);

}

fn update_str(Word :&mut String){
Word.push_str(string: "World")
}
