You can also implements structs, which means you can attcah funtions to instance of structs

Example

struct React {
    width: u32,
    height: u64
}

impl React {
    fn area(&self)->u32{
        return self.width * self.height;
    }
}

fn main(){
    let rect : Rect = Rect{
        width: 50,
        height: 60
    }
    println!("The area of the rectangle is {}",rect.area())
}

**Unit Struct**
Struct with no attributes
struct NoShape
