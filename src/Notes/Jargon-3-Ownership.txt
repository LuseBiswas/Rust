Owenership in Rust which makes it etremely memory safe, which tells when to drop variables and when to dellocate the memory.

Each peice of data in Rust has a single owner at any given time. When the owner goes out of scope, Rust automatically deallocates the memory associated with that data, preventing memory leaks.

What is Owenership?

Owenership is a set of rules that givern how a Rust program manages memory.
 
There are 3-types of Memory Management

1.) Some languages have Garbage collection that regularly checks for no-longer used memory as the program runs

2.) Other languages, the programmer must explicitly allocate and de-allocate and free the memory

3.) RUST uses the Third Approach: Memory is managed through system of ownership with set of rules that the compiler chekcs.

If any of the rules are violated, the program won't complile. None of the the features of ownership will slow down your programm while its running.

Rust Way:-

- Anytime put something on the heap then there must be some variable on the stack that will own it (ownership).
