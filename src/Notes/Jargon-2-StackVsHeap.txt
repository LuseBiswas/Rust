How the Rust do memmory management under the hood?

Rust has clear rule about Stack vs Heap Data management

Stack: Fast allocation and dellocation. Rust use Stack for more primitive data types and for data where size is know in compile time.

Heap: Used for data that can grow ate runtime, such as vector and string.

--------------------------------------------------
What's stored on the Stack?
Number: i32, i64, f64
Boolean: true, false
Fixed Size Arrays

What's stored in the Heap?
Strings
Vesctors
