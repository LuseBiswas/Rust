Enums in Rust is similar to Enums in Typescript. They allow you to define a type by enummerating its possible variants

Example

enum Direction{
    North,
    East,
    South,
    West
}

fn main(){
    let my_direction = Direction::North;
    move_around(my_direction)
}

fn move_around(direction: Direction){

}

**Enum With value**
enum Direction{
    North(f64),
    East(f64),
    South(f64),
    West(f64)
}

fn main(){
    let my_direction = Direction::North(5.0);
    move_around(my_direction)
}

fn move_around(direction: Direction){

}
